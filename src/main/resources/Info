1. issue while building the project, related to version, resolved after updating maven-compiler-source verion in pom
2. issue while connecting to db: In mongo URI, database name is also needed after cluster
3. Cluster not picking up from env file..for now hardcoded in application.prop
4. Got access error (invalid auth cred) while connecting to database, removed env.variablesName from prop file, put directly varName
Cluster problem also solved by this
5. GetSingle movie api was not working, giving whitelabel error. replaced @RequestMapping annotation on class level

but need to implement user specific functions like findBySomethingElse etc
We only need to define getMovieByColumnName, spring boot understand, no need to implement
